## About Us

**The Laboratory of Computational Functional Genomics** focuses on advancing biomedical research through systems biology approaches, leveraging the power of bioinformatics and computational biology. Our core mission is to develop innovative methods for the analysis and integration of multi-omics data to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving diseases. By bridging the gap between biology and computation, we aim to accelerate the generation of testable hypotheses and identify novel therapeutic targets in both human and animal studies.

In addition to our work on disease mechanisms, we are deeply invested in modeling host-microbiome interactions. Our research seeks to unravel how microbial communities influence human health, contributing to either wellness or disease, and to provide insights into how these interactions can be modulated for therapeutic purposes.
